## Hidden uninitialized

Hides elements until the class `is-uicc-initialized` is added to the `body` tag

    @example
    <div class="uicc-hiddenUninitialized" style="height: 200px; padding: 1rem; background-color: turquoise;">This element is hidden until the "is-uicc-initialized" is added to the "body" tag</div>
